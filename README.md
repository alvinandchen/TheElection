# TheElection
The is an election simulator written in Processing developed by Craig Chen and Alvin Chen. Our objective is to create a comprehensive simulation in which the user has jurisdiction over parameters that may influence election outcomes. There are two political parties, represented by the colors red and blue. Each square unit is a “population,” and each rectangular block represents a district. The user has jurisdiction over the following: map size, peer influence, wild factor (spontaneity), and other forms of election influence. This simulation should be an accurate simplification of modern-day democratic elections.
